Drupal module to provide GUI to ACDH-CH ARCHE repository solution.

## Temp Files
The plugin is generating cache files from the downloaded collections and 3d files. 
For maintenance reasons we use a cron job to delete these files every day at 7:00.
The file is available here: https://github.com/acdh-oeaw/arche-gui/blob/master/inst/delete_tmp_files.sh
